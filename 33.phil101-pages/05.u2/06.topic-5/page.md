Another challenge with arguments written in ordinary discourse is not only that they’re written horizontally but they lack keywords for identifying premises and conclusions. When there are no keywords for identifying premise and conclusion, the reader must interpret what the author intended to say and then determine which statements are the premises and conclusion. Consider two examples, the first simpler and the second more complex. The first example is the following:


!!! “I think Lucy is mortal. She is human and humans are mortal.”

This example does not include a keyword for the conclusion but rather uses the phrase “I think.” Furthermore, note that the conclusion comes first, “I think Lucy is mortal.” That informal way of writing the conclusion makes identification more challenging. Premise (1) also includes the pronoun “she”, which in this case refers to “Lucy.” Note also that premises (1) and (2) are statements within the same sentence, respectively, and lack keywords for identification. In most situations, arguments resemble this example in that they are unclear, and one must interpret the argument according to what the author intended to say. If we apply the steps from the previous examples, first label the premises and conclusion with letters:

(C) I think that Lucy is mortal. (P) She is human, and (P) humans are mortal.

Now that the argument is labeled, order the argument vertically with abbreviations in parentheses, and then **observe** the added keywords that provide a clear interpretation. For example:

1.       **Lucy** is human. (P)
2.       **All** humans are mortal. (P)
3.      **Therefore**, Lucy is mortal. (C)


Now the final version of that argument is clearer. We ordered the premises and conclusion vertically, replaced the pronoun “she” with “Lucy,” added the keyword “All” to premise (2), on the assumption that the author intended to refer to “all” humans and not “some” humans, and added the conclusion keyword “Therefore.”

The second more complex example is the following:
!!! “Dogs must be man’s best friend.” Dogs are loyal and kind.”

In this example, there are no relevant keywords, and the conclusion may not be obvious. The task, then, is to carefully interpret the sentences and their relationship with each other to discover (1) does an argument even exist? and (2), if yes, then what are the premises and the conclusion?

Identifying the argument can be difficult. One technique for identifying obscure arguments like the one above is using the “Why/Because” strategy. A conclusion can always be followed by asking a hypothetical “Why?” and a premise can always be introduced with the term “Because.” Consider the following:  


!!! “Dogs must be man’s best friend. (**Why**)?...(**Because**) Dogs are loyal and (**Because**) dogs are kind.”

The first statement, “Dogs must be man’s best friend,” can be followed by asking “**Why** do you think that claim is true?” The second and third statements can be introduced with the term “because”. This process demonstrates that the first statement, followed by the term “why,” is the conclusion, and the second and third statements, preceded with the term “because,” are the premises. So, in difficult cases with a lack of keywords, locate the statements and note which statement best follows with a “Why?” (likely the conclusion), and the statements that best precede with a “Because” (likely the premises supporting that conclusion).

However, at times that strategy may create confusion because most statements could in principle be followed with a hypothetical “Why?” For example:


!!! “Dogs must be man’s best friend. Dogs are loyal **(Why?)** and dogs are kind.”

In that example, the statement followed by the hypothetical “why?” is not the conclusion, but one could technically apply the strategy in that case, thereby creating confusion. How does one resolve this confusion? One strategy is to answer the “Why” question with the other statements involved, and test and compare each statement with another until the conclusion becomes more apparent. For example, suppose one wishes to test the statement, “Dogs are loyal,” to discover if that statement is the conclusion:

!!! “Dogs are loyal.” **Why?**

Answer that question by using only the other two statements involved, for example:

1.       Dogs are loyal. **Why? Because** dogs must be man’s best friend.
2.       Dogs are loyal. **Why? Because** dogs are kind.


Neither answer to the question seems accurate, because dog loyalty has to do with other characteristics absent from those statements. That process indicates that the statement, “dogs are loyal,” is likely not the conclusion. Repeat the process with the other two statements until a conclusion becomes evident.  If there’s no apparent conclusion, then that may show the argument is poorly constructed.

A final comment is the terms “why” and “because” may be used in sentences without invoking an argument. For example,

!!! “I’m at the birthday party because I was invited.”

Those statements do not (really) constitute an argument even though the term “because” is used and the term “why” is implied.

### Label and Structure the Arguments Vertically
:fa-pencil: This activity has two steps. The first step is to click/drag the appropriate letter into the box to label the premises and conclusion. In the second step, click/drag the appropriate premise and conclusion to complete the vertical argument.

_Checklist:_
- Focus on statements and ignore non-statements.
- Locate the premises and conclusion using keywords. **NOTE: use the “Why/Because” strategy for difficult cases.**
- Label the premises and conclusion using letters in parentheses.
- Restructure the argument vertically, with premises on top and the conclusion on the bottom.
- **Note the keywords that are added to the premises and conclusions in step 2.**



Example:

!!! “I think all children are artists. Marcie is a child. Marcie must be an artist.”

**Step 1:** Label the arguments

!!! (P) I think all children are artists. (P) Marcie is a child. (C) Marcie must be an artist.

**Step 2:** Restructure the argument vertically

1. **All** children are artists. (P)
2. Marcie is a child. (P)
3. **Therefore**, Marcie is an artist. (C)
