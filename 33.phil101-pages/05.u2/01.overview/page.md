## Overview
The second unit focuses on reason. In this unit, the goal is to learn (i) what is an argument, and (ii), how does one identify an argument. The skill of identifying arguments applies to many areas of life and it’s important to practice this skill. When you listen to Joe Rogan, Jimmy Kimmel, people on TikTok, Facebook, Fox, and CNN, one should search for the argument and then restructure the argument in its strongest form. Only after that process is complete does one then focus on evaluating the truth of the argument. (We do not cover evaluating the truth of arguments in this unit. Consider enrolling in Phil 103, 105, or 210 to explore how to evaluate arguments).

This unit is divided into the following topics:
1.  The Parts of an Argument
2.  The Keywords of an Argument
3.  Labeling an Argument
4.  Restructuring an Argument
5.  Interpreting an Argument
6.  Arguments with “If…Then”
