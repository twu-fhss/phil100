# Unit 1: Wisdom

In this unit, students are exposed to literature expounding wisdom in different ways. The facilitator should not teach the readings in detail and so the facilitator needn’t become familiar with the vast literature surrounding each reading. Rather, the facilitator should (i) direct students towards the intended goal of that reading outlined in Moodle (using the “Reading Highlights”); and (ii), provide some degree of freedom for students to explore other ideas they encounter from the reading. That freedom will depend largely on the knowledge and competency of the facilitator.

&nbsp;

### Learning Activities and Assignment
The learning activities, including the reflection questions, simulation exercises, and videos are all optional. The only graded assignment for Unit 1 is the reflection questions at the end of the unit. The optional activities are designed to support the student in preparing for their Unit 1 assignment and as optional talking points for the facilitator during class.

### Assignment
Students must submit their Life Skills Video following the grading rubric. The instructor must grade this assignment using the grading rubric and return to students within 10 business days.

### Unit 1 | Tips for Instruction
The first preamble summarizing the entire course (see above) briefly introduced the importance wisdom, reason, and faith for living a good life. The preamble for Unit 1, however, should focus in detail on the importance of wisdom for living a good life. The facilitator must convey (i) the idea that the pursuit of wisdom is valuable for everyone, regardless of profession; and (ii), a reminder of how students are being evaluated in that unit.

The facilitator may use the optional learning activities for classroom talking points. For example, after introducing and discussing the reading, watch the video with the students in class and allow them to discuss those ideas.
