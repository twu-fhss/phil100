# Unit 3: Faith

In this unit, students learn about faith. Characteristic of Unit 1, the facilitator should not teach the readings in detail and so the facilitator needn’t become familiar with the vast literature surrounding each reading. Rather, the facilitator should direct students to (i) different conceptions and applications of the term “faith” (e.g., “hope” and “ethics for salvation”); and (ii), provide a degree of freedom for students to explore issues of faith, such as doubt, disbelief, and how faith and wisdom may coincide or not. That freedom will depend on the knowledge and competency of the instructor.

### Learning Activities and Assignment
The learning activities in Unit 3 are optional but provide structure for the student to prepare for their Reflection Paper. The facilitator must grade the Unit 3 assignment using the attached rubric.

### Unit 3 | Tips for instruction
The preamble should convey the general importance of faith and how faith coincides with both wisdom and reason. While the majority of students may align with Christian faith, some students will not. It’s important for the facilitator to convey the importance of faith for both believers and non. For example, one way that faith coincides with wisdom is the act of investigating the truth or falsity of faith (e.g. doubt, charity, bias, etc.), and that investigation is important for both believers and non. One way that faith coincides with reason is the application of identifying arguments associated with faith. In some cases, believers fail to properly identify arguments that may undermine the truth of faith, and unbelievers may fail to properly identify arguments that may support the truth of faith.
