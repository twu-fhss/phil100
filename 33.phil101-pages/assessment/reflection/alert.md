!!!! Your Unit 3 assignment must be answered in the proper academic language following the instructions provided.

&nbsp;

## Option 1 - Reflection Essay

  1. Write a 750-word reflective essay on Pojman’s view of faith. Your essay should include (i) a brief summary of Pojman’s position (optional: if you’re able, try to summarize his position with an argument with premises and a conclusion), and (ii), your personal reflection and evaluation of Pojman’s view.

  2. Write a 750-word reflective essay on religious doubt. Your essay should include (i) clear definition(s) of doubt and faith, and (ii) if and how doubt and faith conflict or coincide or both.

  3. Write a 750-word reflective essay on Boyd and Thorsen’s chapter three. Your essay should include a brief summary and evaluation of one of the central ideas in chapter 3.

  4. Your position on if and how the principles of wisdom in Unit 1 align with a Christian view of wisdom. If you choose this option, then you should briefly discuss what you think the principles of Christian wisdom entail, if and how these principles align with the principles of wisdom in Unit 1, and for what reasons.    

  5. Your position on religious faith. Do you think religious faith is solely about a  set of beliefs and trust? Why or why not? Do you think that faith requires action? Why or why not? If so, what types of actions? Do you think that if there is a God, that God will hold people responsible for their actions or inactions, regardless of their beliefs? Why or why not?

  6. Your position on one’s obligations to the poor. What are these obligations, if any, and for what reasons? Do these obligations align with Christian faith or not? Why or why not?

#### Tips for writing an essay:

1. **Time**. Give yourself as much time as possible to write the essay.
2. **Outline**. Construct a blueprint of the the essay with bullet points, main points and sub-points. What is the essay about? What topic are you reflecting on? What question are you attempting to answer? Try to get a general idea of what you’re writing about and how you’re going to outline that idea. One way to test the general flow of your essay is to imagine yourself presenting the essay in powerpoint with a 10 min time limit. How would you condense your work? What are the major sections and subsections that would be covered?
3. **First draft**. Write a first draft of the essay. Draft the introduction by describing succinctly the details of the essay. For example, “In this essay, I will argue that…xyz”. Or, “In this essay, I will reflect on such and such.” This is a reflection essay and so using first-personal pronouns is appropriate (first-person is also appropriate in other types of essays, depending on the topic, field, etc.). Also note that sometimes you learn about your essay while writing. As you write, new ideas may come to mind that better align with your objective. So writing a first draft may not reflect the final product. Rather, the first draft functions as the brainstorming process necessary for writing the final product.
4. **Second draft**. Rewrite the essay from beginning to end.
5. **Third draft**. If you have time.
6. **Edit**. Read the essay 20 more times. Spend more time editing the essay than drafting the essay. Read over and over until you can read the entire essay without finding any errors (there are always errors, to be sure, but your task is to reduce those errors as much as possible). Try to locate unnecessary words and remove them. Avoid using confusing terms. Imagine you’re writing for your own mother with the aim that your mother understands the content without additional help. Double check that the flow of the essay is clear and rearrange sections/paragraphs if required.
7. **Polish**. Double-check sources and citations, titles, page numbers, margins, class section, name, date, spacing, etc.
8. **Final Reading**. Read the entire document one last time before submitting.
